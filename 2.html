<h2>Surrealism</h2>
<h3>Rene Magritte</h3>

<strong>René Magritte</strong>was a Belgian-born artist who was known for his work with surrealism as well as his thought-provoking images.<br>
Magritte's earliest paintings, which date from about 1915, were Impressionistic in style.[2] During 1916–1918, he studied at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels,[4] under Constant Montald, but found the instruction uninspiring.[2] He also took classes at the Académie Royale from the painter and poster designer Gisbert Combaz.[5] The paintings he produced during 1918–1924 were influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism" target="blank" title="Futurism">Futurism</a> and by the figurative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism" target="blank" title="Cubism">Cubism</a> of Metzinger.</p>

Magritte's style of surrealism is more representational than the "automatic" style of artists such as Joan Miró. Magritte's use of ordinary objects in unfamiliar spaces is joined to his desire to create poetic imagery. He described the act of painting as "the art of putting colors side by side in such a way that their real aspect is effaced, so that familiar objects—the sky, people, trees, mountains, furniture, the stars, solid structures, graffiti—become united in a single poetically disciplined image. The poetry of this image dispenses with any symbolic significance, old or new.""

René Magritte described his paintings as "visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable."</P>
